Ceylon syntax highlighting and indentation for vim

This project contains some files that will allow **vim** to highlight syntax and indent Ceylon code.

Copy `syntax/ceylon.vim` to your `~/.vim/syntax` directory and `indent/ceylon.vim` to your `~/.vim/indent` directory.

This is a work in progress (especially the indentation rules).
